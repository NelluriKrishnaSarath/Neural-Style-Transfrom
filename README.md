# 🧠 Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
### 🧠 NEURAL-ART: Ghibli Style Transfer App 🎨  
### ✨ Turn Your Photos into Magical Studio Ghibli Art

Transform everyday images into stunning, stylized masterpieces using **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** powered by **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. This web-based project uses **VGG19** to blend the **content of a real photo** with the **style of a Ghibli-style artwork** – a perfect fit for artists, designers, and anime enthusiasts.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Features

- Pre## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Upload content & style images via UI
- 🧠 Uses VGG19 for content & style extraction
- ⚙️ Optimization via Adam and gradient descent
- 💾 Saves output image locally
- 🌐 Flask-based interactive web app

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Upload a **content image** (your photo)
2. Upload a **style image** (Ghibli frame or painting)
3. The app fuses them using:
   - **Content Loss** from deep layers
   - **Style Loss** using **Gram Matrices**
4. The output is saved and previewed in your browser.

# ▶️ Running the App

python app.py

# 💡 Applications
🎨 Art creation & digital filters

📱 Social media style filters (like Prisma)

📷 Creative photography & anime-style transformations

👩‍🏫 Educational demo for CNN feature extraction

# ⚠️ Limitations
🖥️ High computational cost for large images

⏳ Takes time to optimize with many iterations

🎞️ No video support yet (future enhancement)

# 🔮 Future Scope

🌈 **Artistic Presets**  
– Pre-load Studio Ghibli-style themes like *Totoro Forest*, *Spirited Sky*, or *Howl's Castle Mood*.

⚡ **Real-Time Video Transfer**  
– Apply style transfer to live webcam or uploaded videos (OpenCV + GANs).

📱 **Mobile Deployment**  
– Package the app using Kivy or React Native for mobile use.

☁️ **Cloud Deployment**  
– Host on Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or Google Cloud for public use.

🖼️ **Batch Stylization**  
– Allow users to stylize multiple photos in one go.
