# 🧠 Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements an image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. It classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct categories, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, and more.

## 📁 Dataset Used

**CIFAR-10 Dataset**  
- 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels)
- 10 classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
- Available directly via TensorFlow/Keras datasets

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing and normalization of image data
- CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers
- Training and evaluation on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Visualization of training accuracy and loss
